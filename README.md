#ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project involves building a classification model to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to real-world healthcare datasets for early cancer detection.
